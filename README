Acme Entertainment Pty Ltd Requirements
Acme Entertainment have commissioned a prototype movie database, however they want to review 
and update this application so it can be used across all the major digital platforms. They require a 
Multi-Platform Report on the merits of the two design options currently used; adaptive and 
responsive. Your team must choose the best option and rework the prototype; this modified version 
is to be presented at the Sprint One assessment point by the first Scrum Master. The development 
or migration of the movie database can be hosted on the cloud or suitable local server. Ensure your 
Lecturer is advised on this decision. Conduct and record suitable testing of the completed sprint one 
development, include this information in the Testing Plan.
